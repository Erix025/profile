🏫 I'm a senior student at Zhejiang University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

🔭 I’m interested in Efficient AI through algorithm–system co-design, focusing on hardware-friendly sparse and quantized module design as well as efficient inference strategies.

🚀 I'm currently a leader of ZJUSCT, a super computing team at Zhejiang University which has won several international super computing competitions.
